I just created a progress implementation of your great library. I am not sure if the way i did, was correct way to do it though. But as i follow up your code i managed it, so take a look at it please. And if you can implement this option to other RoadRunner types as well, that would be actually great. Maybe you can create much more generic way then i did, i just needed this implementation so i modified it quickly.

I also implemented programmatically creation of the view with Builder, but it can be optimise and make it more generic though.
